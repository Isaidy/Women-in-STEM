    <div class="button 1">Do you dare?</div>
    <h1 class="secondtitle 2">Young Girls</h1>
    <p class="girls 2">"In general, female and male students perform equally well in mathematics and science on standardized tests, but larger gaps exist between students of different racial and ethnic backgrounds or family income, with white and Asian/Pacific Islander students and those from higher income families scoring higher than their counterparts who are black, Hispanic, or American Indian/Alaska Native or who are from lower income families"-ngcproject.org</p>

    <h1 class="thirdtitle 3">Teens</h1>
    <p class="teens 3">"While the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that technology professionals will experience the highest growth in job numbers between now and 2030, only a fraction of girls and women are likely to pursue degrees that enable them to fulfill these news jobs.”-news.microsoft.com</p>

    <div class="button3 3">Do you dare?</div>
    <h1 class="fourthtitle 4">Adult Women</h1>
    <p class="adult 4"> “In 2012, white women earned 6,777 PhDs in STEM fields. On the other hand, white men earned 8,478 PhD degrees. For African American women, that number dwindles to 684—10 times fewer scientific doctorates than their white counterparts. With only 3.5% of STEM bachelor degrees, Latina women face an even larger obstacle.”</p>

         <div class="container 5">
         <div class="left">If the problem starts in childhood, that’s where we start the process. Parents and educators can usher young women (especially black and brown girls) into STEM careers with lifestyle-driven educational programs that ignite creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, and communication.
